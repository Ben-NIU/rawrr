## Abstract

...

## Keywords

proteomics, software, R package

## Introduction

...


## Implementation

...

Example file sample.raw contains 574 fourier-transformed orbi trap spectra (FTMS) recorded on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Q Exactive HF-X. The mass spectrometer was operated in line with a nano electrospray source (NSI) in positive mode (+). All spectra were recorded using centroiding (c) and applying lock mass correction.

## Results

### Use Case I - Analyzing orbi trap spectra

...

### Use Case II - Working with chromatograms - iRT regression

...


## Conclusions
