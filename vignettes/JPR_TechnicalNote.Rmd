## Abstract

The Bioconductor project has shown that the R statistical environment is a highly valuable tool for genomics data analysis (https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3252), but with respect to proteomics we are still missing low level infrastructure to enable performant and robust analysis workflows in R. Fundamentally important are libraries that provide raw data access. Our R package rawDiag (doi:10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00173) has provided the proof-of-principle how access to mass spectromerty raw files can be realized by wrapping vendor-provided APIs. Our novel package rawR now aims for complete, OS independent access to all spectral, chromatographic and meta data logged in Thermo Fisher Scientific raw files. rawR interoperates with other R packages for proteomics data visualisation (protViz) and will ...

## Introduction

## Implementation

...

The binary example file sample.raw contains 574 fourier-transformed orbi trap spectra (FTMS) recorded on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Q Exactive HF-X. The mass spectrometer was operated in line with a nano electrospray source (NSI) in positive mode (+). All spectra were writen to disk after applying centroiding (c) and lock mass correction. Additional raw data for demonstration and extented testing is vaialable through the [tartare package](https://github.com/cpanse/tartare). Lions love raw meat!

## Results

### Use Case I - Analyzing orbi trap spectra
